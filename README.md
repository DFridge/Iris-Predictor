🌸 Iris Flower Predictor

A simple Machine Learning project that predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its physical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

This project uses the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify the flower into one of the three Iris species:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

🚀 Features

- 📊 Uses real-world Iris dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
- 🔍 Predicts the flower type from user input.
- 📈 Visualizes predictions and dataset using a scatter plot.
- 🤖 Trained using `scikit-learn`'s KNN algorithm.
- ✅ Accuracy display and confusion matrix.
